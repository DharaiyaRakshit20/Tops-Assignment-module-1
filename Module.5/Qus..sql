-- 1. 
-- Ans : A database is an organized set of logically connected data. The information transforms into helpful knowledge, structured and maintained to
--       fit the user's needs. Apart from storing the data itself, a database also keeps the relationships between data points.

-- 2. 
-- Ans : Normalization in SQL is a technique that organizes data in a database by eliminating redundancy and enhancing integrity12345.
--       It divides larger tables into smaller tables and links them using relationships25. It also prevents insertion, update,
 --      and deletion anomalies that may occur in the data25. Normalization is a multi-step process that follows some set of rules12.
 
 -- 3. 
 -- Ans : What is the Difference between DBMS and RDBMS? DBMS stands for Database Management System, and RDBMS is the acronym for the Relational-
 --       Database Management system. In DBMS, the data is stored as a file, whereas in RDBMS, data is stored in the form of tables.

-- 4. 
-- Ans : Codd's twelve rules are a set of thirteen rules (numbered zero to twelve) proposed by Edgar F. Codd, a pioneer of the relational model for
--       databases, designed to define what is required from a database management system in order for it to be considered relational, i.e., 
--       a relational database management system (RDBMS).

-- 5.
-- Ans : Data redundancy occurs when the same piece of data exists in multiple places, whereas data inconsistency is when the same data exists in 
--       different formats in multiple tables. Unfortunately, data redundancy can cause data inconsistency, which can provide a company with unreliable
--       and/or meaningless information.

-- 6.
-- Ans : DDL Interpreter interprets the DDL statements and records the generated statements in the table containing metadata.

-- 7.
-- Ans : A data manipulation language (DML) is a computer programming language used for adding (inserting), deleting, and modifying (updating) data 
--       in a database. A DML is often a sublanguage of a broader database language such as SQL, with the DML comprising some of the operators in the language.

-- 8. 
-- Ans : SQL constraints are used to specify rules for the data in a table. Constraints are used to limit the type of data that can go into a table.
--       This ensures the accuracy and reliability of the data in the table. If there is any violation between the constraint and the data action, 
--       the action is aborted.

-- 9. 
-- Ans : savepoint (plural savepoints) (video games) A designated spot where the player can save their progress.
--       The syntax for a SAVEPOINT command is as shown below. SAVEPOINT SAVEPOINT_NAME; This command serves only in the creation of a 
--       SAVEPOINT among all the transactional statements. The ROLLBACK command is used to undo a group of transactions.

-- 10. 
-- Ans : A trigger is a special type of stored procedure that automatically runs when an event occurs in the database server. 
--       DML triggers run when a user tries to modify data through a data manipulation language (DML) event. DML events are INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE
--       statements on a table or view.
